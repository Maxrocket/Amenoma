## Q&A

- Q: Wrong Columns/Lines while using a ultra-wide screen.
- A: Restart the game after changing resolution.

---------------

- Q: Could not scan while using a controller.
- A: Switch the control mode to 「Mouse & Keyboard」 before using.

---------------

- Q: The numbers of items/materials are not completely accurate and some fail to be scanned.
- A: This is normal because it scans the screen for recognition instead of reading memory。

---------------

- Q: Not supported the artifact/materials from the latest version.
- A: Just update the program. Because it's a manually-trained model, it takes me a few days to update the program.
